Conversations in this field are often dominated by Western activist groups and scholars, which poses the danger of leaving out gender identities rooted in non-Western contexts. Unfortunately, many educational materials, as well as scholarly resources, discuss concepts of gender identities using Western terms, and it is difficult to locate educational content that touches on the diversity of gender across the world. Thus, in this project we create a game for children, as well as anyone interested in widening their understanding of gender in global contexts, with a focus on introducing terminologies that are present in various cultures around the world.</div><div class="block text-block">Western notions of gender and sexuality, most typically those such as gay, lesbian, and transgender, are often viewed as global normalities. However, these terminologies that were crafted in the West, and more specifically, the United States, are extremely limited and fail to capture the diversity of identities in the global landscape. In reality, various cultures around the world have developed their own terms and concepts of gender before Western activist organizations began dominating the global discourse. For example, the hijra identity in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan can be traced back to its presence in ancient sacred Hindu texts. \cite{harvard} However, this identity is not as well known as an identity with Western origin such as "transgender," because Western activists are currently dominating the global LGBTI+ scene.</div><div class="block text-block">Thus, The goal of my project is to create an interactive game that can be played on any web browser where users can learn about various gender identities that are present throughout the world. My hope is that, users who have only been familiar with the Western gender-related terms will be able to virtually travel to different parts of the globe and ultimately digest the message that the common LGBTI+ discourse we encounter in many parts of society are quite limited and exclusive, and that it is important to recognize the diversity of gender identities across different cultures.. I would like my game to act as a step towards creating a more inclusive discourse of gender.</div><div class="block text-block">I created a 3-dimensional game where, on the main page, the player is presented with a globe. There are markers on parts of the globe where the player can visit, and they will be able to select which cities to visit by clicking on the markers. Once the player clicks on a city, they will be transported to that location and interact with characters and objects within that geographic location. Through interaction with different characters in that city, the player will be able to learn about the gender identities (and related sexualities, if applicable) that are specific to the cultural groups that occupy that area. After visiting all of the virtual cities, the player will obtain a more diverse and inclusive understanding of gender terminologies throughout the world.</div><div class="block text-block">I chose the cross-platform game development engine, Unity, to create the game. The engine allows a flexible setup of scenes and graphic user interfaces within the game, and I was drawn to the fact that the interface on the editor allows the developer to inspect the scene while making live changes, as in Figure\ref{fig:unity}. The component model makes programming events and interactions with C# scripts intuitive and relatively simple, which is exactly what was needed for a smaller project like this game, since it does not call for too many complex interactions between characters. Furthermore, the ability to build with WebGL allows easy hosting on the web. Finally, the large asset store, which was well-documented and supported by a great development community made Unity a great fit for a first-time game developer.</div><div class="block text-block">The steps taken to implement the project are as follows:<br>Research and select culture-specific terms to include in the game.<br>Write and edit dialogue scripts for the various cities .<br>Convert the scripts into a JSON format that can be parsed using the Unity C# scripts.<br>Obtain models to design the scenes with (characters and environment).<br>Construct scenes in the Unity editor to represent each city by arranging model objects, creating materials for various objects, designing lighting, and more.<br>Create animations for transitions between scenes, displaying UI components, moving the characters, etc.<br>Write the appropriate C# scripts for collision detection, event handling, parsing and displaying the dialogue programmatically, and more.<br>Build the game with WebGL and host on a Web server.</div><div class="block text-block"></div></div><script src="/christine/project.f6f3ffc790253b8539a7.js"></script></body></html>
